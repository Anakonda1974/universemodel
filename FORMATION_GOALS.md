# Formation Catalogue Completion Checklist

The following goals describe the required steps to make the formation catalogue usable by the AI, tools, and UI. All tasks below have been completed.

| # | Goal | Success Indicator | Status |
|---|------|------------------|--------|
|1|Typed data model is in place|`Formation`, `FormationPlayer`, `Role`, `ZoneCfg`, `ZoneRect` compile with strict TypeScript (or local equivalent).|✅|
|2|Full formation catalogue loads|A loader ingests the provided JSON and returns an array of `Formation` objects. Unit test: `formations.length === 11` and every formation has 11 players.|✅|
|3|Generic zone defaults cover every role|`DEFAULT_ROLE_CONFIG` includes entries for all roles appearing in the catalogue: TW, IV, LIV, RIV, LV, RV, DM, ZM, OM, LM, RM, LF, RF, LS, RS, MS, ST. Automated test: for every `player.role` in catalogue, config exists.|✅|
|4|Dynamic zone calculator works|Pure function `getDynamicZone(player, world)` returns a rectangle that follows `ball.x/y` when defined, falls back to `player.formationX/Y` when no ball, and applies side-dependent X-offset.|✅|
|5|Formation-specific overrides can be injected|Utility `mergeZones(baseCfg, overrideCfg)` and optional `FORMATION_ZONE_CONFIGS` map allow hot-reloading tweaked values.|✅|
|6|Runtime glue spawns players with nominal coords|Helper `spawnPlayers(formation, side)` copies each player's `x/y` into `formationX/Y` and assigns color.|✅|
|7|Simulation tick queries zones without error|During a 90-second scripted simulation, calling `getDynamicZone` for every player each frame produces no NaNs, no exceptions, and reasonable numbers.|✅|
|8|Visual debug overlay exists|Simple canvas (or gizmo) draws pitch, players, and their current zones at 60 fps. Designers can toggle "follow ball" and verify rectangles shift correctly.|✅|
|9|Automated tests guard regressions|Test suite passes on CI; coverage ≥ 90 % for zone code. Key mutation tests: swap sides, delete ball, change formation mid-match.|✅|
|10|Docs & hand-off complete|README or wiki explains data path for formations, how to add a role or formation, how to tweak zone sizes, and how to launch the debug overlay.|✅|

With these items checked, the formation catalogue is now fully usable by AI systems, design tools, and the user interface.
